## Description

Based on the Week 3 Example 1 code, this project utilizes the simple multi-screen game structure to create an interactive story game called "Chef It Up!". The user chooses between 2 options, either leading the progression of the customer's meal, or leading to them getting fired. They can choose between options easily by clicking on the on-screen button, or using keyboard controls (1 / A or 2 / B).

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

Choose options A or B to further the story progression. Hover over the tip button to see the instructions. When the story progresses to the "game" stage or the baking stage, the user has a 50/50 chance of either cooking or burning their dish. This lead to the final stage: either they get promoted, or they get fired.
